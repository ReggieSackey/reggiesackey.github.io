<center><h1>Tech. Politics. Sports. Music. Marketing.</h1><center>
<h5><p1>I am passionate about the intersection between technology, politics and the arts and the possibilities this offers for communication.</p1><br><br>
	<p1>I graduated with a degree in Political Science from Grinnell College (Grinnell, IA) in 2016, and with a better lens with which to view the global socio-political landscape. This, combined with the experiences of my youth spent in Ghana witnessing the impact of technologies often taken for granted in people's lives, has obligated me to devote myself to delivering technologies that marry the aforementioned concepts to make a difference in people's lives. Another key skill I learned from my college education is the ability to synthesize information to craft compelling stories through different media</p1><br><br>


	<p1>I am a self-taught web developer, videographer, graphic designer, sound engineer, music producer and meme historian, and in my spare time, I enjoy nothing more than learning new skills, pretending I'm a DJ and engaging in twitter debates.</p1></h5>
